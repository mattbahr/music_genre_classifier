# Music Genre Classifier
The script was run inside a Docker container with GPU-enabled TensorFlow pre-configured. All paths are hard-coded to point to volumes within the container. The pretrained and trained variables can be set to dictate if the model should be trained from scratch or loaded from the disk. 
See the abstract for details on architecture, training, and performance.
